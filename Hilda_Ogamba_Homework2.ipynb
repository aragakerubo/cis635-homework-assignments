        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will implement the **Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB)** algorithm in Python and explore its impact on feature selection for machine learning models, focusing specifically on the Bayesian Network approach. The IAMB algorithm incrementally selects features that have the strongest association with a target variable, resulting in a subset that approximates the Markov Blanket. This feature selection process is crucial for identifying the most relevant variables and can lead to improved model performance and interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment aims to:\n",
        "- Implement a simplified version of the IAMB algorithm based on pseudocode.\n",
        "- Apply IAMB for feature selection on a sample dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).\n",
        "- Evaluate and compare model performance with and without IAMB-based feature selection using **Gaussian Naive Bayes**.\n",

        "### Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset\n",
        "The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the following attributes (TYNECKI, 2018):\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pregnancies (number of times pregnant),\n",
        "\n",
        "- Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl),\n",

        "In this assignment, you will use the `pingouin` library to calculate partial correlation as the measure of association for the IAMB algorithm. This calculation will help you assess the conditional relationship between features and the target variable. Detailed usage of the `pingouin.partial_corr` API can be found here: [Pingouin Partial Correlation](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/generated/pingouin.partial_corr.html#pingouin.partial_corr).\n",

        "   - Use the `pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv` dataset. This dataset contains features relevant to predicting diabetes in individuals. After loading the data, apply the IAMB algorithm to select features most relevant to the target variable (`Outcome`).\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Evaluate Model Performance**:\n",
        "   - Split the data into 70% training and 30% testing sets.\n",
        "   - Train a **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier using:\n",
        "     - **All features** (baseline model).\n",

        "The results demonstrate that feature selection using the IAMB algorithm significantly enhances model performance by focusing on the most relevant predictors—**['Glucose', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'BMI', 'Pregnancies']**. The IAMB-selected model outperforms the all-features model across all key metrics, showing higher **accuracy** (0.770563 vs. 0.744589), **F1 score** (0.769499 vs. 0.746309), and **AUC-ROC** (0.828063 vs. 0.790480). This indicates that the selected subset of features not only improves predictive power but also maintains a better balance between precision and recall. By using only these four features, the model is simpler, more interpretable, and computationally efficient while still achieving superior performance. Overall, this underscores the importance of targeted feature selection to build effective, robust, and interpretable machine learning models."
